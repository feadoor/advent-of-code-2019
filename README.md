# Advent of Code 2019

Here are my solutions to Advent of Code 2019. I'm attempting to solve each problem in both Python and in Haskell.

## Python 3

The Python solutions are initially written speedily when the problem first becomes available, and are possibly given
a cursory tidy up after submission.

To run a Python solution, simply run `python XX.py` from the `python` subdirectory of this repository.

## Haskell

The Haskell solutions are written after I have a working Python solution, so they have the advantage of not having
any code written until I already understand the problem and its solution quite well. They have the disadvantage of
being written by someone who isn't very good at Haskell.

To run a Haskell solution, make sure that you have `cabal` installed and run `cabal run DayXX` from the `haskell`
subdirectory of this repository.
